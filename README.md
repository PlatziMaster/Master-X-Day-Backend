REST is faster than SOAP on web, SOAP is a protocol that needs specific requierments like XML to comunicate
REST API's are also light, so we can use them in mobile development or new context as IOT also  it was designed for work with media, flies comonents or even at hardware devices like IOT devices(sensors, actuators, gadgets, appliances, or machines) and SOAP offers more complex requierments, what makes them heavier.
